# Statcast-Prediction

Enormous work in progress. For now, only including for reference a very sloppy and silly hit prediction model notebook based on [similar work](https://baseballwithr.wordpress.com/2018/08/21/r-code-for-probability-of-hit-given-three-variables/) from the [baseballwithr](https://baseballwithr.wordpress.com/) folks. Data acquired using [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball).
