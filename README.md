# Statcast-Prediction

Binary hit prediction modeling based on [similar work](https://baseballwithr.wordpress.com/2018/08/21/r-code-for-probability-of-hit-given-three-variables/) from the [baseballwithr](https://baseballwithr.wordpress.com/) folks. Data acquired using [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball). This project was mainly undertaken to practice skills like creating and populating PostgreSQL databases using Python and working through a relatively thorough machine learning workflow, and not to be taken too seriously.
